Documentation for eBiota
======================

Welcome to the online documentation for eBiota.

eBiota is a platform for *ab initio* designing microbial communities with desired functions, including maximizing the production or degradation efficiency of target compounds, from a large-scale microbial seed pool. Based on deep learning and rapid optimization algorithms, eBiota is also able to predict the behavior of microbial communities, including their relative abundance, co-occurrence, substrates, productions, and cross-feedings. eBiota integrated three building blocks: CoreBFS, ProdFBA, and DeepCooc. 

For more information, see our paper: **Ab initio design of microbial communities from large-scale seed pools using deep learning and rapid optimization**. eBiota is built and maintained by the `ZhuLab`_ at Peking University. All codes are available at `Github`_.
