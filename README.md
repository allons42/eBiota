## Introduction

We developed eBiota, a set of computational tools for the reliable and efficient design of community based on desired properties. eBiota combines fast and scalable processing of large seed pools, precise prediction of the outcomes, and the ability to design potentially stable communities. eBiota covers virtually any bacterium and function that can be inferred from genomic data. Examples include maximizing the production or degradation efficiency of a target compound, which are primary goals in the field of constructing microbial factories. eBiota is built as an integrated set of three algorithms: CoreBFS, ProdFBA, and DeepCooc. The first layer, CoreBFS, is a graph-based search algorithm that determines whether a bacterium possesses intact metabolic pathways from substrates (or intermediates) to products (or intermediates). It completes the search rapidly by memorizing molecules and metabolic pathways. The second layer, ProdFBA, is a multi-step linear programming algorithm. Compared to classical FBA, ProdFBA infers metabolic flux distributions for microbial communities with potential maximum production or degradation efficiency, with output being a first selection of microbial communities likely to maximize the target properties. This output is then fed into DeepCooc, a novel deep learning algorithm that employs residual neural networks (ResNet) to predict high-order co-occurrence in microbial communities. It has been trained on data from 23,323 samples across various environments and human body sites. DeepCoocâ€™s performance is significantly superior to competing methods we tested. This final step filters out communities to only retain those with a potential stability under the target conditions.

## Installation

Following the steps below, the installation on a normal desktop computer would take a few minutes.

### 1. Create Conda environment

We recommend installing eBiota in a virtual environment with Conda.

```bash
# Download latest version of eBiota
git clone https://github.com/allons42/eBiota.git
cd eBiota/src/

# Create and activate a conda environment "ebiota_env"
conda create -n ebiota_env python=3.9
conda activate ebiota_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install DeepCooc

The DeepCooc module, used for co-occurrence analysis, utilizes deep learning and requires the installation of the PyTorch package. Please refer to the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) official website to choose the appropriate CUDA version or CPU version for installation. We used the 1.12.0+cu113 version, and other versions should be feasible.

```bash
# Install PyTorch with conda or wheel on Linux
# Conda
conda install pytorch==1.12.0 torchvision==0.13.0 torchaudio==0.12.0 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch

# Wheel
pip install torch==1.12.0+cu113 torchvision==0.13.0+cu113 torchaudio==0.12.0 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
```

After installing PyTorch, you need to download necessary files from Zenodo:

```bash
wget -O DeepCooc_files.tar.gz https://zenodo.org/records/13895108/files/DeepCooc_files.tar.gz?download=1
tar -xzvf DeepCooc_files.tar.gz -C stats/
rm DeepCooc_files.tar.gz
```

### 3. Check if the installation is successful

```bash
python eBiota.py --Function test
```

### 4. [Optional] Install CarveMe

CarveMe is a tool we used for GEM rebuild. You can install CarveMe with the following commands. See the [document](https://carveme.readthedocs.io/) for more details.

```bash
pip install carveme
conda install -c bioconda diamond
```

### 5. [Optional] Install Gurobi optimizer

We recommend using *Gurobi* as Linear Programming solver, as it is much faster than the default optimizer *glpk*. The *Gurobi* solver is free for academic use ([see here](https://www.gurobi.com/features/academic-named-user-license/)). Please follow the instructions to install *Gurobi*.

## Quickstart

eBiota supports various functions for microbial community design. For a quickstart, we provide an example to design communities that utilize glucose and produce hydrogen. The whole process would take about 10 minutes.

```bash
python eBiota.py --Function doall
```

There are plenty of configurations to customize your communities, detailed in `config.json`. Here list some important configurations:
